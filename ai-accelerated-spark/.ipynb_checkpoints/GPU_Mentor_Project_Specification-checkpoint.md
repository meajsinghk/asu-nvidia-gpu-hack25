# PROJECT SPECIFICATION: Enhanced GPU Mentor with Agentic RAG

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW & GOALS

### **Primary Objective**
Prototype and enhance a GPU Mentor application using an agentic RAG system (LangGraph/LangChain/Ollama) that teaches GPU acceleration through hands-on experimentation. The system should provide an interactive learning environment where users can submit code, receive optimization suggestions, and run actual performance benchmarks on the Sol supercomputer.

### **Core Mission**
Transform traditional GPU learning from theoretical documentation to practical, interactive experimentation by combining AI tutoring with real-world performance validation.
