## ⚡ Quick Start for Your Friend

### Prerequisites
- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support
- **Python 3.8+** 
- **Sol environment** or Linux/Windows with CUDA drivers
- **Internet connection** for dataset download

### Simple Installation & Run
```bash
# Linux/Mac
chmod +x start_backend.sh
./start_backend.sh

# Windows
start_backend.bat
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the complete notebook in Jupyter
jupyter notebook complete_sol_backend.ipynb
# Then execute all cells in order
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints Available

Once running, your frontend can connect to these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check and system metrics |
| `/execute/numpy` | POST | Execute CPU-based NumPy code |
| `/execute/cupy` | POST | Execute GPU-accelerated CuPy code |
| `/rag/query` | POST | AI chat queries about parking data |
| `/data/summary` | GET | Dataset information and statistics |
| `/data/analyze` | POST | Custom data analysis operations |

## 📊 Frontend Integration

Update your frontend's environment file (`.env.local`):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOL_BACKEND_URL=http://YOUR_FRIEND_SOL_IP:8000
```

## 🎯 Dataset Information

**Source**: NYC Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2022
**URL**: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2022/7mxj-7a6y

**Focus Columns**:
- `violation_time` - When the violation occurred
- `violation_location` - Location/precinct of violation  
- `street_name` - Street where violation happened
- `days_parking_in_effect` - Parking restriction days

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CUDA Issues
```bash
# Check CUDA installation
nvidia-smi
python -c "import cupy; print(cupy.cuda.is_available())"
```

### Port Issues
If port 8000 is busy, edit the startup scripts and change:
```python
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)  # Use different port
```

### Memory Issues
For systems with limited GPU memory, reduce dataset size in the notebook:
```python
# In the notebook, change this line:
dataset_url = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/7mxj-7a6y.csv?$limit=50000"  # Smaller limit
```

### Network Access
Ensure firewall allows port 8000:
```bash
# Linux
sudo ufw allow 8000

# Windows: Add firewall rule for port 8000
```

## 📈 Performance Benefits

- **GPU Acceleration**: 5-50x speedup for data operations compared to CPU
- **Real-time Processing**: cuDF processes millions of records in seconds
- **Intelligent Chat**: RAG system provides contextual answers about parking data
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU, GPU, and memory usage in real-time

## 📝 What Your Friend Needs to Do

1. **Copy this entire folder** to their Sol environment
2. **Run the startup script**: `./start_backend.sh` or `start_backend.bat`  
3. **Wait for "Server will be available at..."** message
4. **Note their IP address** and share with you
5. **Keep the server running** while you use the frontend

## 📡 What You Need to Do

1. **Get the backend URL** from your friend (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8000`)
2. **Update your `.env.local`** file with their URL
3. **Restart your frontend**: `npm run dev`
4. **Test the connection** - Your UI will now send requests to their Sol backend
5. **Enjoy GPU-accelerated processing!**

## 🎉 Features Available

- **Execute GPU code remotely** - Your frontend sends code to run on their GPU
- **AI chat about parking data** - Ask questions, get intelligent answers
- **Real-time performance monitoring** - See GPU/CPU usage during processing
- **Data analysis operations** - Group, filter, and analyze millions of records
- **Seamless integration** - Your existing frontend UI works unchanged

## 🔗 Example API Usage

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://sol-ip:8000/health
```

### Execute GPU Code
```bash
curl -X POST "http://sol-ip:8000/execute/cupy" \
